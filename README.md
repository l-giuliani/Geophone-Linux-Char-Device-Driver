## Geophone Linux Device Driver

This project is a simple Linux Char Device Driver for geophones (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophone).  
Talking about hardware the presence of a module that set a gpio high when the voltage registered  exceeds a certain threshold, and low when the voltage returns below the threshold, is expected.  
The Linux driver counts the rising edge of interrupts generated by the hardware.  
Is possible to set by user space the gpio used and is possible to read the current status.  
The driver handles two devices under /dev and each of them can handle a dedicated gpio for the geophone.  
  
An example of user space application that uses the driver is provided.
